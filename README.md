# Dental Patient Model Ontology (DPMO)

## Information about DPMO ##
As a biological, a psychological and a social being, a human is a complex organism. The human mouth just like the other body parts interacts with the rest of the body. While considering a dental treatment for a patient, a patient’s biological, psychological, and social status should be taken into consideration as a whole. A dentist should be knowledgeable and familiar with these characteristics of the patient. It is essential that this knowledge should be stored systematically for preventing endangering the patient’s life due to medical errors and for deciding as well as carrying out the most appropriate dental treatment for the patient. Unfortunately, there is not any formal dental patient model for electronically storing and modeling patient characteristics and behavior currently.

DPMO is an ontology that captures general information excluding patient’s dental health status which is also important to dentists while deciding for a treatment. The contribution of DPMO is that it is the first and the only formal dental patient model available currently. As a case study, DPMO is used in a prototype dental information system. By using OWL ontologies, the system is able to store electronic health records of the patients, to share patient records among different hospitals and to provide physicians expertise to assist them in decision making. 

By using DPMO and rule-based reasoning, treatment options which are most suitable to the patient characteristics can be presented to the dentist since DPMO makes it possible to achieve a more complex and complete dental patient representation.
